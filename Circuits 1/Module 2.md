- # Current and Voltage
- Naming Conventions
	- General use: Lower case letters
		- i, v, or i, v,  may or may not be time varying
	- Time varying (t)
		- i(t) and v(t) are time varying (non-constant)
	- Not time varying (DC): capital letters
		- I, V, are DC (constant) values
	- Bold: Something special (matrix, vector, phasor version of i(t), Laplace or Fourier Transform, etc.) **I V**
- # Physics behind Current and Voltage
	- The concepts of electric charge is the basis for describing all electrical phenomena
	- In circuit theory, the separation of charge creates an electric force (voltage), and the motion of charge creates an electric fluid (current).
	- Electric charge is bipolar, meaning that electrical effects are described in terms of positive and negative charges
	- Electric charges exist in discrete quantities, which are integer multiples of the electronic charge, $1.6022 * 10^{-19}$
	- Electrical effects are attributed to both the separation of charge and charges in motion
- # Current
	- The electrical effects caused by charges in motion depend on the rate of charge flow. The rate of charge flow is known as the electric current, which is expressed as $i = \frac{dq}{dt}; \space q(t) = \int_0^ti(x)dx$, where:
		- i = the current in amperes (A).
		- q = the charge in coulombs (C)
		- t = the time in seconds (s). 
- # Voltage
	- Whenever positive and negative charges are separated, the energy is expended. Voltage is the energy per unit charge created by the separation. We express this ratio in differential form as $v = \frac{dw}{dq};\space w=\int v \space dq$
- # Power and Energy
	- Mathematically, power is energy per unit time and is expressed in the form of a derivative, $p = \frac{dw}{dt}$
		- p = Power in Watts (W)
		- w = Energy in Joules (J)
		- t = Time in Seconds (s)
	- 1 W is equivalent to 1 J/s
	- The power associated with the flow of charge follows directly from the definition of voltage and current$p = \frac{dw}{dt} = ( \frac{dw}{dq} ) ( \frac{dq}{dt} ) = vi$
	- Energy in integral form: $w = \int_0^tp(x)dx$
- # Comparing Gravitational Potential Energy to Electrical Energy
	- Another way to think about voltage

	- Assume mass is analogous to charge, then voltage is analogous to height
	- Voltage is a measure of electric potential, light height is a measure of gravitational potential
- # Assumptions for Circuit Theory
- Three basic assumptions permit us to use circuit theory to study a physical system represented by an electric circuit
	- 1. Electrical effects happen instantaneously through a system.
		- Electric signals travel at or near the speed of light
		- For physically small systems, electric signals affect every point in the system simultaneously
		- A system that is small enough so that we can make this assumption is called a lumped-element system
	- 2.  The net charge on every component in the system is always zero. Thus, no component can collect a net excess of charge.
	- 3. There is no magnetic coupling between the components in a system

	- Positive current flows from the positive terminal of a voltage source (active circuit element)
	- Positive current will flow into the positive terminal of a resistor (passive circuit element)
- # Passive Sign Convention

	- The battery and resistor can be abstracted to ideal basic circuit elements (blocks)
	- An ideal basic circuit element has three attributes 
		- 1. It has only two terminals, which are points of connections to other circuit components
		- 2. It is described mathematically in terms of current and/or voltage
		- 3. It cannot be subdivided into other elements

- # Passive Sign Convention - Power
	- Whenever the reference direction for the current in an element is in the direction of the reference voltage drop across the element (as in the figure), use a positive sign in any expression that relates to voltage in the current. Otherwise, use a negative sign.

	- Interpreting Algebraic Sign of Power:
		- If the power is positive (that is, if p > 0), power is being delivered to the circuit element represented by the box. Or the circuit element is absorbing power.
		- If the power is negative (that is, if p < 0), power is being extracted from the circuit element or the circuit element is supplying power, (additional book terminology – developed power)
- # Conservation of Energy
	- Using passive sign convention, calculate the total power of the system
