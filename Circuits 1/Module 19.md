# Sequential Switched RL & RC Circuits [14:47]
* Whenever switching occurs at two or more distinct times in a circuit, we have sequential switching. For example, a single, two-position switch may be in position 1 at t1 and in position 2 at t2, or multiple switches may be opened or closed in sequence. We determine the voltages and currents generated by a switching sequence using the techniques described previously in this chapter. We derive the expressions for v(t) and i(t) for a given position of the switch or switches and then use these solutions to determine the initial conditions for the next position of the switch or switches. 
* With sequential switching problems, a premium is placed on obtaining the initial value x(t0). Recall that anything but inductive currents and capacitive voltages can change instantaneously at the time of switching. Thus, solving first for inductive currents and capacitive voltages is even more pertinent in sequential switching problems. Drawing the circuit that pertains to each time interval in such a problem is often helpful in the solution process.
