* # What is a source?
	*  device that converts non-electric energy into electrical energy
	* Ideal source: Delivers or absorbs power at a relatively fixed voltage or current. What does this mean?
	* Batteries, Generators, etc..
* # Independent Sources
	* Independent sources do not rely on anything in the circuit. A constant voltage or current will be output no matter the load.

* ![[Pasted image 20250122160216.png]]
	* The source maintains a set current through its terminals regardless of the voltage across it's terminals. 
* # Dependent Sources
	* A dependent source ***depends*** on another voltage or current  in the circuit
	* ![[Pasted image 20250122160336.png]]
	* Similar constraints are applied to other dependent sources - containing both a multiplying constant and a controlling voltage or current.

* # Passive & Active Elements
	* Both Active and Passive elements are responsible for power distribution in a circuit.
	* Passive element:
		* Do not produce electricity
		* Can be used to manipulate circuit in terms of voltage, current, and power. 
		* ![[Pasted image 20250122160550.png]]
	* Active elements
		* Do not generate electricity
		* Control flow of current in a circuit (Independent / dependent sources)

* # Electrical Resistance and Ohms Law
	*  What is a resistor?
		* A passive device that impedes current (i)
		* ![[Pasted image 20250122160830.png]]
		* Resistance - A measure of how stongly a material opposes current $R = \rho \frac {L}{A}$ 
		* ![[Pasted image 20250122160919.png]]
		* The electrical current flowing through a fixed linear resistance is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it, and also inversely proportional to the resistance (Ohm's Law).

		* ![[Pasted image 20250122161035.png]]
	* Conductance
		* Resistance: A measure of how strongly an element OPPOSES current
		* Conductance: a measure of how EASILY electricity flows through an electricla current
		* $G = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{V}\space (\mho , \space mho) (Siemens,\space S)$ 
* # Short Circuit and Open Circuit
	* ![[Pasted image 20250122162036.png]]
	* When circuit is closed, R = 0, when open, R = $\infty$        
* # Diodes and Rectifiers
	* AC --> DC Conversion
	* Semiconductor component that allows current preferably to flow in one way.  
	* Symbol = ![[Pasted image 20250122162644.png]]

		* Typically $V_\gamma$ ~ 0.5-0.8v
		* Exponentially decreasing value is the Breakdown voltage. 
	* Diodes are a non-linear element
		* Using this means the linear techniques we've discussed cannot be used.
	* Kinds of Diodes
		* LEDs
		* Laser Diode
		* Photodiode
		* Solar cell
		* Zener Diode
	*  Diode Models
		* Ideal Diode
		* Offset Diode
