# Response of First Order RL/RC [4:18]
* In this chapter, we focus on circuits that consist only of sources, resistors, and either (but not both) inductors or capacitors. We call these circuits RL and RC circuits. In chapter 6, we saw that inductors and capacitors can store energy. We analyze RL and RC circuits to determine the currents and voltages that arise when energy is either released or acquired by an inductor or capacitor in response to an abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source. 
* We divide our analysis of RL and RC circuits into three phases.
* First phase: Find the currents and voltages that arise when stored energy in an inductor or capacitor is suddenly released to a resistive network. This happens when the inductor or capacitor is abruptly disconnected from its dc source. Thus, we can reduce the circuit to one of the two equivalent forms shown below. These currents and voltages characterize the natural response of the circuit because the nature of the circuit itself, not external sources of excitation, determines the behavior. ![[Pasted image 20250228121758.png]]
* Second Phase: Find the currents and voltages tht arise when energy is being acquired by an inductor or capacitor when a dc voltage or current source is suddenly applied. This response is called the **step response**
* Third phase: Develop a general method for finding the response of RL and RC circuits to any abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source. A general method exists because the process for finding both the natural and step responses is the same.

* RL and RC circuits are known as first-order circuits because their voltages and currents are described by first order differential equations. No matter how complex a circuit may appear, if it can be reduced to a Thevenin or Nortion equivalent connected to the terminals of an equivalent inductor or capacitor, it is a first order circuit. If the original circuit has two or more inductors or capacitors, they must be interconnected so that they can be replaced by a single equivalent element. After introducing the techniques for analyzing the natural and step responses for first-order circuits, we will discuss three special cases:
	* Sequential switching (circuits in which switching occurs at two or more instants in time)
	* Circuits with an unbounded response
	* The integrating amplifier circuit (containing an op-amp)
	* 
# The Natural Response of RL Circuits [24:19]
* We can describe the natural response of an RL circuit using the circuit below. We assume that the independent current source generates a constatn current Is and that the switch has been in a closed position for a "long time. " We define the phrase *a long time* more accurately later in this section. For now it means that all currents and voltages have reached a constant value. Thus only constant, or dc, currents exist in the circuit just before the switch opens, and the voltage across the inductor is zero (Ldi/dt = 0). Therefore, before the stored energy is released
	* The inductor behaves like a short circuit
	* The entire source current Is appear in the inductive branch
	* There is no current in either R0 or R
* ![[Pasted image 20250228122956.png]]
* To find the natrual response, we find the voltage and current at the terminals of the resistor R after the switch has been opened--that is, after thee souce and its parallel resistor R0 have been disconnected and the inductor begins releasing energy. If we let t = 0 denote the instant when the switch is opened, we find v(t) and i(t) for t >= 0. For t >= 0, the circuit shown below reduces to the one to the right![[Pasted image 20250228124213.png]]
* To find i(t), we write an expression involving r, R, and L for the circuit below using KVL. Summing the voltages around the enclosed loop where we used the passive sign convention. The equation below is a first order ordinary differential equation because it involves the ordinary derivative of the unknown di/dt and the highest order derivative appearing in the equation is 1 $$L\frac{di}{dt} + Ri = 0$$ We can go one step further in describing this equation. The coefficients in the equation, R and L, are constants; that is, they are not functions of either the dependent variable, i, or the independent variable, t.
