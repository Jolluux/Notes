# Kirchhoff's Current and Voltage Laws Definitions [12:00]
* Kirchhoff's current law (KCL):
	* The algebraic sum of currents at any node is equal to zero
		* $\sum_{n=1}^{N}{i_n} = 0$  
	* Note: Node - Point in a circuit where two or more elements meet.
* Example:

* Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
	* The sum of voltages around a closed path = 0
	* The sum of voltage drop = sum of voltage rise
		* $\sum_{n=1}^{N}{v_n} = 0$
	* KVL Steps
		* Add voltages in a clockwise fashion
		* Assign a (+) sign to the voltage across the element if (+) terminal is encountered first.
		* Assign a (-) sign if the (-) terminal is encountered first.
