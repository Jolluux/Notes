# Number Representation and Arithmetic Circuits
* ## Unsigned Integers and Other Representation
	* Unsigned numbers
		* All bits represent the magnitude of a positive integer
		* 1111 = 15
	* Signed numbers
		* left most bit represents the sign of a number
		* 1100 = -4
* ## Half Adder
	* **slides not posted**
* ## Addition of Multi-Bit Numbers
	* binary addition lol
* ## Full Adder
	* one of them
* ## Ripple-Carry Adder
	* multiple of them
* ## Signed Numbers
	* 1s comp
	* 2s comp
	* The works
	* Weird graphic abt it
	* Positive and negative 0 is bad
* more dlog review
* ## Full Adder in VHDL
```vhdl
libary ieee;
