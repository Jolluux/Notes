* # Benefits of Research
	* PhD Programs
		* Required for many faculty / professor positions
		* Usually entirely research-based beyond master's coursework
		* Admission Requirements
			* Quality Publications and Lab Experience
			* Academic Statement of Purpose (SOP)
			* Personal Statement (PS)
	*  Internships / National Labs
		* Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU)
			* Research-based internship (University Affiliated)
			* Ex. Software Engineering Institute @ CMU
		* National Labs
			* Research-based Internship (Federally Affiliated)
			* Ex. sandia Labs, Oakridge Labs
		* industry Internships
			* Oftentimes requires "prior experience"...
			* Also companies have research divisions (Ex. IBM Research)
	* Funding Scholarships
		* UF-based Undergraduate Funding Opportunities
